Controller DSL
  - helpers for views like --  <% requires_role(:role) do %>HTML HERE<% end %>
  - specs (test dsl in isolation, test controller implementations)
  - verfity/decide whether actions/roles/perms are tacked on, validated within the parents or completely override parents
  - move actual role/permission checks into #allow? and #deny? - would decouple ACL DSL from ActiveRecord Authorization
  - clean up logging (create logger class that prefixes with ACL)



ActiveRecord Authorization
  - account for namespaces when setting classes like Publishers::Role (or test if it just works as is?)
  - make sure context excludes permission methods when not used
  - allow forcing/restricting contexts (so subject can only be assigned permissions within that context and lookups don't go up the chain)
  - create mixins for join models to add validations and associations, etc.
  - allow block for configuring acts_as_authorization_*
  
  - include a default Role and Permission model + generator for migration?
  - generators for Role, Permission, RolePermission, SubjectRole, SubjectPermission models?
  - generators for migrations to add fields to custom Role, Permission models?

  - maybe rework some of the method and association names to use the provided values instead of the keys (like :user instead of :subject). alternately maybe figure out a way to namespace acts_as_*? would allow something to behave with many acts_as_* without a conflict (i.e. possess Roles AND SpecialRoles)
  - look into defining scopes, use :default scope by default, allow naming acts_as_authorization_* :name => 'my_scope'
  - genericize the active record stuff for objects (just check if responds to :authorization_find or something), create activerecord datasource and move the table-related stuff there



General
  - error/exception classes and messages
  - i18n error messages
  - add :debug config, create logger class, log activerecord stuff as well
