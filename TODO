Controller DSL
  - helpers for views like --  <% requires_role(:role) do %>HTML HERE<% end %>
  - specs - test dsl in isolation with dummy controller object, test controller implementations
  - clean up logging (create logger class that prefixes with ACL)



ActiveRecord Authorization
  - allow forcing/restricting contexts (so subject can only be assigned permissions within that context and lookups don't go up the chain)
  - DRY up some of the shared stuff like #context and #context=

  - genericize the active record stuff for objects (just check if responds to :authorization_find or something), create activerecord datasource and move the table-related stuff there
  
  - include a default Role and Permission model + generator for migration?
  - generators for Role, Permission, RolePermission, SubjectRole, SubjectPermission models?
  - generators for migrations to add fields to custom Role, Permission models?



General
  - error/exception classes and messages
  - i18n error messages
  - add :debug config, create logger class, log activerecord stuff as well



NOTES
  ACL DSL
    + actions, roles and permissions are tacked on to any default/parent :actions, :roles or :permissions
    + moved role/permission checks into #allow?, #deny? and #match? - allows decoupling ACL DSL from ActiveRecord Authorization by overriding those methods in the DSL block or in a monkeypatch
