0.2.7:
* Put a temporary, ugly hack in place to force Heroku production deploys to work until I can find a real solution

0.2.6:
* No longer raising an exception when overriding an existing scope, relying on developers to do what they need

0.2.5:
* Adds support for ActiveRecord4 (and by extension Rails4) and Strong Parameters (when using ActiveRecord ~>4.0.0 and NOT using the protected_attributes gem)
* Clean up some of the model associations to better support custom class names and namespaced classes
